  Review                   = {- travel time modeling (predict travel time)
- method: combination statistic and ANN
+ The state-space notion of traffic processes and State-Space Neural Network (SSSNNet) models are used on simulation generated traffic data. 
+ Conditional Independence (CI) graphs are used to identify independence and interaction between observable traffic parameters thus only relevant ones can be used to predict travel time.
+ analyze the complex relationship between travel time and observable parameters like speed, flow, occupancy, etc.
- data: from simulation (traffic flow condition, average speed, avarage occupancy, sotrage on a link, link length, number of lanes... signal control setting....)
- results:The model worked well and efficiently for both congested and non-congested traffic conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {The existing well-known short-term traffic forecasting algorithms require large traffic flow data sets, including information on current traffic scenarios to predict the future traffic conditions. This article proposes a random process traffic volume model that enables estimation and prediction of traffic volume at sites where such large and continuous data sets of traffic condition related information are unavailable. The proposed model is based on a combination of wavelet analysis (WA) and Bayesian hierarchical methodology (BHM). The average daily 'trend' of urban traffic flow observations can be reliably modeled using discrete WA. The remaining fluctuating parts of the traffic volume observations are modeled using BHM. This BHM modeling considers that the variance of the urban traffic flow observations from an intersection vary with the time-of-the-day. A case study has been performed at two busy junctions at the city-centre of Dublin to validate the effectiveness of the strategy. },

  Abstract                 = {This study describes an approach for predicting travel time by kriging. The kriging method, which is a means of spatial prediction, is used as prediction measure for car travel time in an imaginary four-dimensional space. Each point in the space represents a single journey: the coordinates of a point are the coordinates of the origin and destination on a plane. The travel time can then be viewed as a function over this four-dimensional space. The prediction relies on the feature that nearby points (in the four-dimensional space) will have almost the same travel time. In this approach, it is not necessary to break down travel times from origin to destination into link travel times. The approach will also allow us to use information from ``probe vehicles'' for travel time prediction in the near future. The feasibility of this approach is demonstrated through a case study in London and its environs. The case study uses 200 observations for verification. The multiple correlation coefficient of estimated travel time and the verification data is 0.9045. The results indicate that 95{\%} prediction limits are between {\textpm}10 minutes and {\textpm}30 minutes for travel between two arbitrary points. This prediction method is effective for urban districts with links having changeable travel time owing to congestion.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper addresses the problem of modeling and predicting urban traffic flow variability, which involves considerable implications for the deployment of dynamic transportation management systems. Traffic variability is described in terms of a volatility metric, i.e., the conditional variance of traffic flow level, as a latent stochastic (low-order Markov) process. A discrete-time parametric stochastic model, referred to as stochastic volatility (SV) model is employed to provide short-term adaptive forecasts of traffic (speed) variability by using real-time detector measurements of volumes and occupancies in an urban arterial. The predictive performance of the SV model is compared to that of the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) model, which has been recently used for the traffic variability forecasting, with regard to different measurement locations, forms of data input, lengths of forecasting horizon and performance measures. The results indicate the},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Since the early 1980s, short-term traffic forecasting has been an integral part of most Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) research and applications; most effort has gone into developing methodologies that can be used to model traffic characteristics and produce anticipated traffic conditions. Existing literature is voluminous, and has largely used single point data from motorways and has employed univariate mathematical models to predict traffic volumes or travel times. Recent developments in technology and the widespread use of powerful computers and mathematical models allow researchers an unprecedented opportunity to expand horizons and direct work in 10 challenging, yet relatively under researched, directions. It is these existing challenges that we review in this paper and offer suggestions for future work. },

  abstract = { City of York Council has been at the forefront of developments in the UK's Urban Traffic Management and Control (UTMC) programme, which aims to exploit the latest developments in communications and information technology to improve traffic management in cities. A major focus of the programme is the employment of a common database to enable the sharing of data between information sources and applications. In York the common database is the heart of the system, not only used for data storage but for the implementation of control algorithms and data processing. The York approach provides an improved service to council officers responsible for network management, for other council officers and members, and for the public at large. The York UTMC system is fully integrated with other council information technology systems and assists in meeting wider e-government targets. The impact of this on the design is significant and raises issues not normally encountered in traditional traffic management systems, particularly in the areas of security and audit, while offering savings through the shared communications infrastructure. A comparison is made between the approach being taken in the UK and similar systems overseas. },

  abstract = {Abstract The present work offers some contributions to the area of surface roughness modeling by Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in machining processes. It proposes a method for an optimized project of a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) network architecture applied for the prediction of Average Surface Roughness (Ra). The tuning method is expressed in the format of an algorithm employing two techniques from Design of Experiments (DOE) methodology: Full factorials and Evolutionary Operations (EVOP). Datasets retrieved from literature are employed to form training and test data sets for the ANN. The proposed tuning method leads to significant reduction of roughness prediction errors in machining operations in comparison to techniques currently used. It constitutes an effective option for the systematic design models based on ANN for prediction of surface roughness, filling the gap reported in the literature on this subject.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a procedure to formulate and solve optimization problems for multiple and conflicting objectives that may exist in turning processes. Advanced turning processes, such as hard turning, demand the use of advanced tools with specially prepared cutting edges. It is also evident from a large number of experimental works that the tool geometry and selected machining parameters have complex relations with the tool life and the roughness and integrity of the finished surfaces. The non-linear relations between the machining parameters including tool geometry and the performance measure of interest can be obtained by neural networks using experimental data. The neural network models can be used in defining objective functions. In this study, dynamic-neighborhood particle swarm optimization (DN-PSO) methodology is used to handle multi-objective optimization problems existing in turning process planning. The objective is to obtain a group of optimal process parameters for each of three different case studies presented in this paper. The case studies considered in this study are: minimizing surface roughness values and maximizing the productivity, maximizing tool life and material removal rate, and minimizing machining induced stresses on the surface and minimizing surface roughness. The optimum cutting conditions for each case study can be selected from calculated Pareto-optimal fronts by the user according to production planning requirements. The results indicate that the proposed methodology which makes use of dynamic-neighborhood particle swarm approach for solving the multi-objective optimization problems with conflicting objectives is both effective and efficient, and can be utilized in solving complex turning optimization problems and adds intelligence in production planning process.},

  abstract = {Estimation of prediction accuracy is important when our aim is prediction. The training error is an easy estimate of prediction error, but it has a downward bias. On the other hand, K-fold cross-validation has an upward bias. The upward bias may be negligible in leave-one-out cross-validation, but it sometimes cannot be neglected in 5-fold or 10-fold cross-validation, which are favored from a computational standpoint. Since the training error has a downward bias and K-fold cross-validation has an upward bias, there will be an appropriate estimate in a family that connects the two estimates. In this paper, we investigate two families that connect the training error and K-fold cross-validation.},

  abstract = {Traffic forecasts provide essential input for the appraisal of transport investment projects. However, according to recent empirical evidence, long-term predictions are subject to high levels of uncertainty. This article quantifies uncertainty in traffic forecasts for the tolled motorway network in Spain. Uncertainty is quantified in the form of a confidence interval for the traffic forecast that includes both model uncertainty and input uncertainty. We apply a stochastic simulation process based on bootstrapping techniques. Furthermore, the article proposes a new methodology to account for capacity constraints in long-term traffic forecasts. Specifically, we suggest a dynamic model in which the speed of adjustment is related to the ratio between the actual traffic flow and the maximum capacity of the motorway. As an illustrative example, this methodology is applied to a specific public policy that consists of suppressing the toll on a certain motorway section before the concession expires.},

  abstract = {We address the problem of finding the optimal number of reference vectors for vector quantisation from the point of view of the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. We formulate vector quantisation in terms of the MDL principle, and then derive different instantiations of the algorithm, depending on the coding procedure. Moreover, we develop an efficient algorithm (similar to EM-type algorithms) for optimising the MDL criterion. In addition, we use the MDL principle to increase the robustness of the training algorithm, namely, the MDL principle provides a criterion to decide which data points are outliers. We illustrate our approach on 2D clustering problems (in order to visualise the behaviour of the algorithm), and present applications on image coding. Finally, we outline various ways to extend the algorithm.},
